All of the code can be run with the scripts "run_analyses.sh" in the synteny subfolders, and "run_SWS2_search.sh" in the genome_wide_SWS2_search subfolders.

You will need to decompress the rna.fa.tar.gz files (tar xvzf rna.fa.tar.gz) in genome_wide_SWS2_search/infiles.


The rhinella marina genome is too large to be shared on github -- you can find the fasta file at https://www.omicsdi.org/dataset/omics_ena_project/PRJEB24695

The pumilio genome is available at https://zenodo.org/record/3696842#.XuHmN0GxWUk

The ranitomeya genome is available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_905332335.1/

The annotated ortholog files (i.e., the lowest blast E-value with Nanorana) are locted in pumilio/genome_wide_SWS2_search/output/most_similar_gene_in_nanorana.xls and rhinella/genome_wide_SWS2_search/output/most_similar_gene_in_nanorana.xls ranitomeya/genome_wide_SWS2_search/output/most_similar_gene_in_nanorana.xls

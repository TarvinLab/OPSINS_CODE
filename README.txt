All of the code can be run with the scripts "run_analyses.sh" in the synteny subfolders, and "run_SWS2_search.sh" in the genome_wide_SWS2_search subfolders.

The rhinella marina genome is too large to be shared on github -- you can find the fasta file at https://www.omicsdi.org/dataset/omics_ena_project/PRJEB24695

The pumilio genome is available at https://zenodo.org/record/3696842#.XuHmN0GxWUk

The annotated ortholog files (i.e., the lowest blast E-value with Nanorana) are locted in pumilio/genome_wide_SWS2_search/output/most_similar_gene_in_nanorana.xls and rhinella/genome_wide_SWS2_search/output/most_similar_gene_in_nanorana.xls
